    <h1>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</h1>

    <p> The purpose of this page is to show what I have learned so far from the well renowned book, "Automate the Boring Stuff" by AlSweigart. While so far what is shown here is fairly limited knowledge, it has been detrimental in my path towards learning Python, and the many ways I can apply the programming language in ways I never imagined possible. It is also to be noted that none of which that is viewed here on this page is my work. It is to be assumed that all credit of the following content should be attrivuted to Al Sweigart and his book. I take no credit, and do not plan to use this content in any capacity other than to learn from.</p>

        <p>Python is programming language that has been on the rise in the past couple decades becoming only second to JavaScript, which surprisingly enough has started to run for its money. Because of its simplistic design and ease of learning, learning programming has become a far more obtainable goal than ever before. While learning Python has indeed been made easier, it can still be considered a daunting task by most. Automate the Boring Stuff With Python has been created to help aspring coders to understand the basic fundamentals of Python, and how big a difference you can make in life by simply knowing a mere amount of it.</p>

        <p>I've run into a good number of problems while taking on personal projects utilizing Python in recent times. You could say that I've jumped the gun in a number of ways, considering that I'm attempting to create a virtual assistant with little to no training with Python. So below, I've constructed a list of quesitons that I need to be answered before I could continue along my path of understanding.

                <ol>
                    <li class="skilllist">How do you properly import modules/libraries</li>
                    <li class="skilllist">What am I supposed to be using to import, pip3 or pipenv?</li>
                    <li class="skilllist">What is the best text-to-speech module to utilize for voice/virtual assistants?</li>
                    <li class="skilllist">Is there a way to command the app to turn on with voice activation only?</li>
                    <li class="skilllist">Are there any recommended books to learn from that teach you how to use the most updated version of Python, rather that 2-3 year old versions?</li>
                </ol>
