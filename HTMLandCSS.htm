    <h1>HTML and CSS</h1>

    <p> The purpose of this page is to reveal what I have learned thus far from reading materials outside of this course. The primary source of the following information comes from "Sams Teach Yourself HTML and CSS in 24 Hours, 9th Edition" by Julie C. Meloni.</p>
    <P> The information provided is not meant to be extensive in any sort of capacity, merely bits and pieces of information retained from my readthrough of the afformentioned book and topic.</P>

       <p> <b>!DOCTYPE html:</b>   Used to tell the webbrowser to expect HTML 5 code, not just HTML</p>
       <p><b>head title /title head:</b>   Used to give the webpage a Title/name; what shows up on the tab not the actual page</p>
       <p><b>body:</b> body text, where the meat and the potatoes of the soup go</p>
       <p><b>p:</b>    paragraph</p>
       <p><b>hr:</b>   horizontal lines on the page.</p>
       <p><b>br:</b>   Page breaks, like pressing Enter on Word.</p>
       <p><b>html:</b> Indicates the start/finish of what html code you want the webbrowser to process.</p>
       <p><b>h1:</b>   Inidcates the first header. Pops up in big text. There's also h2-h6, whose size and boldness gets smaller in each iteration.</p>

        <p>While HTML is the meat and potatoes, CSS is the onions, carrots and garlic of the soup. It's there to make everything
            on the web page look pretty, and taste delicious. This particular language has the ability to interlace itself with
            HTML and design it to your own liking. The beauty of it is that potentially, you can make it look however you want
            it to.</p>
        
        <p>Also, as a side note, you're actually learning CSS3. Supposedly, it's common to refer to CSS3 as simply CSS, as it is
            assumed by most individuals would have made the switch. Either way, it's good to make that ascertation when building
            a resume to impress; ensure you know what you're doing and what you're talking about.</p>
        
        <p>At the end of the day, CSS isn't a lot of code, and it really comes down to personal preference. </p>
        <P>In most CSS files created, you'll see HTML tags being used. Essentially, with CSS you can call upon certain parts of
            an HTML file and tell CSS how we want it to look.</P>
        <p>Remember, you MUST end each "rule" put into place in the CSS file with a semicolon(;), otherwise you could cause
            potentially fatal errors in your code.</p>
        <p>Include a link tag in the head section of each document you want to use the style with.</p>
